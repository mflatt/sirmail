SirMail is an IMAP client that is implemented in Racket. The only
known user of SirMail is its author --- who uses it as his main mailer
so that he's always testing Racket.

(SirMail used to be in the main Racket repository, but now it's in its
own gthub repository and normally installed using Planet 2.)
